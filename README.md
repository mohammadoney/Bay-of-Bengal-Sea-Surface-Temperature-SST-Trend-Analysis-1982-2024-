Data Preparation:
NOAA OISST V2.1 daily SST data for 1982–2024 was extracted over the Bay of Bengal region using Google Earth Engine.
Annual median composites were generated for each year and stacked into a multi-band GeoTIFF for spatial and temporal analysis.

Analysis:
Temporal Trend: Basin-wide annual median SST was analyzed using the Mann–Kendall test to detect monotonic trends and Sen’s slope to quantify warming rate.
Spatial Pattern: Pixel-by-pixel Mann–Kendall analysis was performed to map trend magnitude (Sen’s slope) and statistical significance (Z-score) across the entire basin.

Result Interpretation:
The Bay of Bengal warmed at an average rate of 0.022 °C/year, amounting to ~0.92 °C total warming over 42 years.
Warming is spatially uniform across the entire basin (0.01–0.03 °C/year everywhere) and statistically significant in all regions (Z > 3).
This translates to a consistently warmer marine environment throughout the Bay of Bengal, with implications for marine ecosystems, cyclone activity, and regional climate.
